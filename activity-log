I want to publish my notes on VuePress to github.  Created repo vuepress-toolbox on git, cloned it to my Mac.

Now to populate the project with my markdown files. Done.  New dir docs under the project--this will be where the build to html points to.  Created .vuepress dir and added config.js. Ran vuepress dev to verify my site so far.

Updated the base field in my config.js to "/vuepress-toolbox/" to match my repo name.

Now using utilities to prepare the HTML static files and uploading them to git.

     vuepress build -d docs  
     git add -A
     git commit -m "initial upload"
     git push origin master

Updating github settings for vuepress-toolbox repo to serve the github pages from the docs folder. The URL will be:

     https://tomlamphier.github.io/vuepress-toolbox

It's working!

Updated the publish doc with the above info.

// to do
1.  Review and revise the vuepress-toolbox site 2 or 3 go-rounds.
2.  Clean up old vuepress stuff.
